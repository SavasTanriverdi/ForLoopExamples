ForLoopExamples

This project demonstrates the use of the for loop in C#. It provides several examples of how for loops can be used for iterating through a range of values, printing numbers in different orders, and performing calculations like factorial.
Project Structure

The Program.cs file includes examples of:

    Printing Numbers: Displaying numbers from 1 to 10 and from 10 to 1 in reverse.
    Filtering Even Numbers: Printing even numbers between 1 and 20 using a condition within the loop.
    Factorial Calculation: Using a for loop to calculate the factorial of a user-provided number.

Code Examples

The following for loop examples are covered in this project:

    Counting Up: Displaying numbers from 1 to 10.
    Counting Down: Displaying numbers from 10 to 1.
    Conditional Counting: Printing only even numbers within a specific range.
    Factorial Calculation: Multiplying numbers from 1 up to a given number.

Example Output

    Numbers from 1 to 10:
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

    Numbers from 10 to 1:
    10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

    Even numbers from 1 to 20:
    2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20

    Enter a number to calculate its factorial: 5
    Factorial of 5 is: 120

How to Run

    Clone the repository.
    Open the project in your preferred C# IDE.
    Run the Program.cs file and observe the different outputs as the for loop examples are executed.

Purpose

This project is intended for beginners learning how to use the for loop in C# to perform repeated tasks, apply conditions within loops, and handle simple calculations.
